# Book Library

Book Library is a webpage project written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS that emulates an online personal book library for users.

## Features

Book Objects are stored in an array after a user inputs a new book from a dialog popup. 

Each book's display has a button to remove the book from the library.

Users can also toggle whether a book has been read or not, by changing its read status.

Currently, there is no storage right now to save the information between page reloads.
